# HEXVERT

### Hi!

This is a little python script that converts a hex string into a normal string (utf-8), little edian or big edian bytes!

I've made this to help me a bit in my reverse-engineering CTFs, but if anyone wants to improve this, you are free to make your pull request and I'll look over it.
